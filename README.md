# Silhouette Score Calculation for K-Means Clustering

This repository contains R code that calculates the silhouette score for a k-means clustering result on the Iris dataset. The silhouette score is a metric used to assess the quality of the clustering by measuring how similar objects are to their own clusters compared to other clusters.

## Introduction

The `silhouette_score_calculation.R` script calculates the silhouette score for a given k-means clustering result on the Iris dataset. It follows the silhouette coefficient formula and iterates through each data point to compute the silhouette score. The script enhances the original code by using separate functions for clarity, modularity, and better readability.

## Usage

1. Make sure you have R installed on your system.

2. Clone this repository or download the `silhouette_score_calculation.R` script.

3. Open the script in an R-compatible environment (e.g., RStudio or R command line).

4. Run the script to calculate the silhouette score for the k-means clustering result on the Iris dataset.

5. The silhouette score will be printed to the console.

## Requirements

To run the script, you need:

- R (https://www.r-project.org/)

Additionally, the script uses the following R packages:

- `cluster`: For k-means clustering and distance calculation.

## Installation

1. Install R by following the instructions on the [R Project website](https://www.r-project.org/).

2. Open an R-compatible environment (e.g., RStudio).

3. Install the required R packages by executing the following commands in the R console:

```r
install.packages("cluster")
```

4. Clone this repository or download the `silhouette_score_calculation.R` script.

5. Open the script in your preferred R environment and run it to calculate the silhouette score.
